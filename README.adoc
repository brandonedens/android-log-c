Introduction
------------

Congratulations in finding this Android log colorizer. This colorizer is based
upon the data presentation and color scheme found in Jeff Sharkey's 
http://jsharkey.org/blog/2009/04/22/modifying-the-android-logcat-stream-for-full-color-debugging/[logcat colorizer].
In addition, this colorizer is written to simultaneously process log information
from all connected Android devices while also implemented in C for maximum
throughput.


Quickstart
----------

android-log uses cmake and pthreads to compile. Please install these libraries
onto your computer prior to attempting a build. To compile and execute use the
standard cmake paradigm such as:

[source,bash]
----
mkdir build
cmake ~/path/to/android-log
make
./src/android-log
----


Hacking
-------

This software follows the following coding style. Bracing is 1TBS, 4 character
indentation, all lower case function and variable names. All caps for constants
separated by underscores. If in doubt refer to CERT secure coding C guide for
advice in what is preferred style.
